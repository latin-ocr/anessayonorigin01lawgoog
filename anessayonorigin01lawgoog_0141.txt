- even these will become agreeable by Eleffion, ands
the Understanding will perceive them to be made
so, and not malsc them to be so. ’Tis not there·
fore the Office of the Understanding to govern the
will, but to discover means for the attamment of
that which is choser'r, and to give waming when it
chooses such things as are absurd or impollible:
For the Understanding, as we said before, judges
that to be good which is agreeable to our Choice,
· except thialead us into Absurdities. ln order there·
fore po avoid Absurdities, we make use of the Un-
derstanding as a Monitor, nota Master. ¹

And from hence, 1 third< it appears how incon-
veniens it would sbc for the Choice to depend in
all cases upon the Understanding. For smce the
Judgment of the Underlianding depende upon the
' Objetis themselves, and the natural congnity which
they bear to the Appetitcs ; if the Choice were to
be determined by its Judgment‚ 'tis evidens that
we must necessarily want a great many things
which the Understanding judges to be good, and
could never hope for solid Happiness‚ (64.)th

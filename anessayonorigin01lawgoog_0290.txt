to produce all the good Effeets which we see consequent ·

ments used by*Cotta against them have no manner of ⁴

force: since we do not plead for such an Understanding,
Reason‚ Justice‚ and Virtue, as he objests against, but sor
more valuable Perfestions that are more than equivalent,

which are such as might be expesied from the most cou-

And asser thelame manner, when perverse Men reason
against the Prescience, Predestination‚ and the Decrees of
God, by drawing the like absurd consequences‚ as Cotta
doth against the possibility of his beloy endowed with Rea-
son and Understanding, &n our An wer is the same as
before mention’d. If these be supposed the very same in
all respests when attributed to God, as we find them in
uurselves, there would be some eolour from the Absurdities
that would follow, to deny thet they belong to God; but
when we only ascribe them to him by analogy, and mean
no more than that there are some things answerable to
them, from whence, as Principles‚ the divine Operatione

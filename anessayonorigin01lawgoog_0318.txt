On the Fall of'Marc. ¹ 529

nocency, without RevealedRelrgion and the ule of Sacramenta

For ‘the discovery of what was Good and Evil was to pro· ,

ceed from a continued Communication of Divine Wisdom, ,
which would have been equivalent to a Revelation; and
the Trees of Knowledge and of Life were truly Sacramen-
tal; they were outward and vifible Signa' and means of
Grace, which is the true notion ofa Sacrament. And then
judge with yourfelves what Pride and F olly it is for any in
this corrupted Estate to pretend 'that they are too spiritual
for such, or that they need them not in order to Commu-
nion with Gou' Man in his ¹State of Perfeeuon needed diem,
how much more must we in our prelent condition of Corrup-
tion and Aversron from God ? Let ps not therefore despise or
’ abufe them. Death was the Consequence of the violation of '
the sacramental Tree in my Text, and the same is threatned ,
as the Punilhment of our abusmg the Christian Sacraments‚
1 Cor. 11. a 9. He that cateth and drinketh unworthily‚ eateth ⁵
¹ and drinketh Damnation to himself, azot discerning the Lord's

« Bady. For this Causa many are weak andstckly among you, · ,

and mum fleep. The neglefling of them is no lese penal,
John 3. 5. Except aMan be born-os Water ancl of the upbit,
he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And John 6. 5 3.
Excentye eat theFlesh of the Son ofMan and drink his Blood,
ye have no Lise in you. These are expressy offered to us in ·,
the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, and we are sure in] v
that the faithful feed on them. And though their feedingg ¹,

may not be confined to the use of the outward Elements,' ⁴ '
yet whoever rejects them, 'debars himself of the spiritual ¹,

Food communicated by them ε for when God has appoint- ·

ed Means to obtain a onlong, it is reasonable to believe
that he will never grant it to those who neglect or contemn

thellld adly, as it is a great Folly to despise the Sacramenta . ι

fo it is much greater madness to think of Happinefs with-

out revealed Religion. It is plain we have a prospe& and ¹

eager desire of a future Life, andin many Circumstances
there is nothing but that hope can make the present toler- ,
able to us. But natural Religion can neither give us any ,
certain clear security of it, nor means to attain it. Revealed
gives both, and the view is so comfortable to agood Man(3

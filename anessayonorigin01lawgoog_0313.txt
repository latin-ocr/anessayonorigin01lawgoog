Government. Instead of attaining her Design, God makes
her subj eii to her Husband·, pigaces those Desrres and In-
clinatione on him which she had withdrawn from God, and
constitutes him her Ruler and Head By this she and her
whole Sex became Subjedis, and dependent on the froward
Will of those Husbands she had corrupted, being 0ὺῦᾗά

God, and to depend on him for rt, as well as for the Go
werument of our Adiions Since we would not do the latter,

God has refused to do the former for us.

Of Mora! Evil„ Chapv.
we mistake the Trudr. But to confess the Truth„

we are hurried on inan absurd Elestion, tho’ we
see and know all that we are about to do: if then
there be any Error, ’tis only this that we judge
it better to enjoy afree Eleetion, than to be exempt
from natural Evils Hence it is evident that there
arises so much Pleasure from Etenion as is ableto
impose upon th'e Understanding, and induce it to ¹
prefer that to all kinds of natural Good; nay to
Life itself. But'whether this be done erroneoussy'
or wisely, 'tis the strongest Argument that we have
. such an Eleetive Seis-pleafing Principle as this with·
rn us.
Secopdly, XVI. Secondly, assor Obstinacy‚ by which they
ofllgffscl’ suppose that we are moved to ,choose absurd things;
helan Ξ, 'tis plain that this is nothing else but the perseve-
benothing rance os a bad Eleslion: neither can Obstinacy and
else ¹³⁰1 Perverseness be explained otherwise thau by Elec-
perseye- tions. ls it be granted that these things please us be-

{yfffll} cause they are chosen‚ we see clearly enough what

‘· Eleuion. Obstinacy is, viz. an unnecellary adherence to an

Eleslion and a Self-complacency in it, contrary to
the distate of Reason, and with the loss of natural

Good. (57.) But if the Will be determined srom

without, there will be no such thing as Obstinacy.
N O TE S. y

(57.) leibnitz (in his Remarks frequently cited above) ar·
goes* ·‘ That Obstinacy is not barely the eontinuance os a
“ bad Eseslion, buta dispohtion to persevere in it, proceed.
“ ing from sorne Good that a Mau forms to himself, or from

Α “some Evil which one supposes to attend the change. The
“ first Eleslio'n, says he, was made perhaps thro' mere lievity,
“ but the resolution of adhering to it comes from some hron-
“ ger Reasons or Impreffions''. But is this be all that is meant
by Obstinacy‚ how come the World to fix so bad a Notion to
that Word? lf it be a disposition always proceeding from a

“ prospe& of Good, or dread os Evil, and founded on second
thoughts and stronger Reasous, how can it ever be deenreda
Crimei Again, if the firjs Eleslion can be made without any

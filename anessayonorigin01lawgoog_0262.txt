'the Freedom of nran’s Will. 473

¹ cvm. And this brings me to xthe second Head which ’
Ῑ proposed to myself in this Discourse, which was to shew
you, Why God and henaenly things are after this manner ’
represented‘to ns in holy Scriptura And the first ReasonI -

shall offer is that we must either becontent to know them x “

this way, or not at all. I have already told you, and 1 be-
lieve every considering Man is convinced, xthat the Nature

and Perfedlions of God, as he isin himself, are such that it ⁴

is impoffible we should comprehend them, especially in the
present State of Imperfedion, Ignorance, and Corruption
in which this World lies. He is the Olijeei of none os our ¹
scoies, by which we receive all our direci and immediate
‘Perception os'things ; and therefore if we know any thing
of ¹ him at all, it must be by deduslions of Reason, by A·
nalogy and Comparison, by resembling him to something ,
that we do know and are acquainted with.
· 'Tis by this way we arrive at the most noble and useful
Notions we have, and by this Method we tcach and inshuct
others. Thus when we would help a Man to some Con-
ce tion os any thing that has not fallen within the reach
o his Senses, wc do it by comparing it to something that
already has ; by offering him some Similitudo, Resemblance,
or Analogy‚ to help his Conception. As for example, to give
aMan a Notion of a Country to which he is a Stranger,
‘and to make him apprehend its Bounds and Situation, we
roducea Map to him·, and by that he obtains as much
knowledge of it as serves him for his present purpose· Now
a Map is only Paper and Ink, diversrfied with several
Strokes and Lines, which in themselves have little likeness
to Farth, Mountains, Valleys, Lake's and Rivers. Yet none
'can deny but by Propontion and Analogy they are very In· ι
‘strudive3 andis any should imagine that these Countriec
are reall Paper, because the Maps that represent them are
made olyit, and should seriouss draw Conclusrons from that
‘Suppositiom he would expose hs Understanding, and make
himself ridiculous: And yet such aa argue from the faint

Resemblances that either Scripture or Reason give os the ,
divine Attributes and Operations, and proceed in their Rea·
sonings as if these must in all respecta answer one anothparli

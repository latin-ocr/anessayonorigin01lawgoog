XXIII. From these and other Arguments which This mis-
might be brought, lthink' it is evident that God haffligh&
given us aPrinciple of this kind, and that our Will hessoni] ¹ '
is only deterrnined by itself. They are· mistaken the Judg.
s therefore who affirm that either the AppetiteS, Parn- mentor

probably gave occasron to the Mistake was‚tha't other standing
things please or d1splease us, befide what we choose, arosenom ⁴

therefore it is not meant of theut, or of this sort os Eril, when
we say we can't choose Evil. But 'rt is absolutely impollible
that we shou'd choose what ia contrary to choice, and su Eril·
iu that seuse; for then we sltou’d choose it and not choose it at
the same time. This give us the reason why, we cannot choose
Eril as surb ; because itia made good by out Choice. Audis

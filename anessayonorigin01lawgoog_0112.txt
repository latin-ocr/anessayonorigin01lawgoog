NOTES. '

Let us eonsrder sarthen that tho' the Angels and Bletsed in
Heaven should have losi'their F reedotu so' far as not to be able ·
to choose Evss, yet thie eloth not take aviay their Chuiee in ·
rother actions. We must not think that these bleiled Creatute‘s
ate altogether idle, und have no bjufineso ot exereise os their
Faculriea't they surely employ themselves in what is good,
¹and a't‘there may be great variety of eitiunt in which they may
‚tltllh‘l‘hilttltllrl‘llh‘rihhilt&theeth
more than another arises from their Choiee. For having no
neeeslities to supply by labour'as we have here, no particular ⁴
exereise is necessary to them, and therefore nothing can be·
,supposed to make one exercise more pleastng than another, but
their Choice. And in truth we count ourse ves the moll happy
here when we have no particular business to oblige us to labour,
but are lest to employ our time as we please.

But luilly, we don’t know how it is with the Saints an'd
Angels in Heaven ; we know they are happy, but how ur by
⁴what means we are entirely ignorant, aud muli be. till we get
there, and therefore no argument ought or can he drawn hom
'the sinte os their llappiness to ours.

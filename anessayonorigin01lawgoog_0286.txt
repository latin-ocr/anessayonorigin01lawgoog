§XXXI . The fourth use Ishail make of this Dostrine, ,
is to enable us to discover what Judgment we are to pass
on those that have mana ’d this controversy: And for V
mine own part 1 must rosch, that they seem to me to have

taken Shadows for subdances, Resemb ances for the Things

they re resent·‚ and by consoun ‘ these have embroiled
themselhes and Readers in inextrica le Difficulties.

Whoever will look into the Books writ on either fide,
will 'lind this to be true: But because that is' a Task too ,
difficult for the generality of Men, let thom consrder the
two Schemes of the Predestinarians and Free-Wller's, in
the Bilhop of Sarum's Exposition of the XVIIth Arti-
cle of our Church; where they will (as Ithink) find the
Opinions of both Parties' briefly, fully, and fairly represent-
ed, and withal perceive this Error runs through both.

As for example, the great Foundation osthe one Scheme ’
is, thar God acts for himself and his Glory, and therefore
he can. only consrder the Manifestation of his own Attri-
butes and Peneorons in every Aetion, and hence they
conclude that he must only damn or save Men, as his do-
ing of one or o'ther ma most promote his Glory.

But here it is manilest that they who reason thus ‘are of

cribed to God in an ardalog'ical Sense, after the same tiran-
netas Hands and F eet, Love and Hatred are: And when
God is saidto do alithin sorbis own Glory, it is not
meant that the Desrre of lory is the real End of his Ac-
tions, but that he has ordered 311 things in such an excellent
Method, that if he had dehgnod them for no other End,

'could not have set it forth more effeetuarly. Now to
m this figurative Expreflion the Foundation of so many
harsh Conclusrons, and the occasion of so many Conten7
tions and Divisions in the Church, seems to me the same

kind of Mistake, that the Church os Rome commits in ¹

that the iinying 0 Son io of sech a Nature ar may be separated ·

ral Emis, and are prejudicio! both to the Anthors themselvm
and others: They mrdermine the Principles of aii Goorinesr,

which from the very Nature he has given Mankind is necessary
to human Happiness: nor need we'mention other Natural
Evils, which would iiow as certainly hom the Aliowaooe or

Answ. 11 the objector had bnt observ& the Distinetion which
the Atthor gives 01 Mora] Evii, Chap- v. introduct. he might
have found a foll anfwer to this ObJettion. There he might
see that aii Emi is inconveniency, but that some inconvenien-
cies nrise from the series of natural Censes without our Conseht
and sometimes our Knowiedget thefe we call naturai Etils3
bot others heppm from the abore 01 erectione, when an un·
due Choice occations them, and in this case befideo the Nato·
rai Eril that aristo from them, there is likewise an Obhigation
00 the Person that makes theChoice to nnswe'r for the hurt

y he has done by it. Now these Choices that bring inconve-
niencies, are cniied moral Eniis, and the difference between
natural andmorai Eril is not bot thatthey both bring incon-
venienties, and hort ourselreo or others (for therein consisto
the nature of their Erit) bot that the iil Effetts 01 the one
prooeed from the Choioe, those 01 the other from natural
Carrion, and hence the hothor 01 thet Choice is mswerabhe for
the one, but no body for the other. Moml Eril therefore it

But 4thly, It isaliedged that Morti Emiis redominant in
the world, nnd yet the Work 01 God is not Jisturb’d by it t

nence was not imposed upon him so much by the way of
tryal, astobe ameans to affurehim os the GraoeandAs-
nstanoe of God‚ This gave him an Interest in his ‚own
Happiness, because it made it in son'te measure depend on
his F ree-Will, without which it could not have been Happi-
ness, as has been shew’d before, and yet it made it so easy

to him, that nothing but the Goodness os God could have
found out so very senstble and so effectum a means. Thus
you see afair meaning and reason of this Command‚ and
that there is no necessity of forsaking the [atter of Scrip
tute to justify God’s imposrng it.

Let us now in the 3d place consider by what means Man
was seduced to break this Command. Of this we have an
Account, Ch. 3. When God aiks the Qestion of the Wo
man, she answers, v. 13, rae Serpent beguiled me and I did
eat. Now it will be necessary, ast, to consider the Sedu·

bath uod said γι shall not eat of every Trea of the Garden?
From which you are to observe, 1st, that this was a literas
Serpent; the same Serpent that is now curs’d, and goes on
his Belly‚ and eats Dust; that is hated and abhorred by
Man, that is so poisonous and pernicious to him, between
whom and Man there is a natural Enmity to this Day, is
literally meant in this place, and is not to be allegorised

ning of Beasts, we must not understand this of him, as

now stupify'd by the Curse os God‚ but as created at first

. in perfetiion. The tradition of whose cunning was socon·

stant and universal that it became proverbial among all the
Antients, with whom to be wise as Serpents (meaning the
first os the kind) denotes the persesiion os Subtlety; which
sstews a general belief that he had at first a Sagacity more
than ordina .

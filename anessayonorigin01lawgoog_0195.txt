mer, 'tis certain that it cannot fall to the Lot of any
Man in this present State, nor is it a Debt due
srorn God to a Creature, tho’ never so innocent.
Since the Condition os Men is, and must necessa·

, rily be such (while we inhabit this Eatth in its pre-

sent State) as will by no means admit os this ab·
solutely perse& Happiness. For Pains, Griefs‚ and
the rest of those which we call naturalitus, can·
not, as things now stand, be totally avoided, but
by the preternatural Favour of the Deity. The

. Earth then must either beileft destitute of Inhabi-

tants, or we must take up with emoderate share
of Happiness·‚ this also is a Gift worthy of God,
and fit to be accepted and embraced by Man.
Neither is this arare Felicity, and which happens
to few Men t for all may enjoy it, and most adiu-
ally do ς especially if they will make a prudent use
of their Eledtions. For is there be any bitter' thing
in Life, it generally flows frorn depraved Eledtions,
and by a right use of these, any thing which creates

uneahness, or can make us weary of Lise, might

Δ be mitigated or removed. To conclude, tho' we

willing to part with it, which is a certain lndication
that it is not a burden to us, and that not so few
attain this moderate Happiness, as the Objedtiun

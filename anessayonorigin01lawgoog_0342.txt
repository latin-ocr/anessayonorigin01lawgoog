an infinite series of succeffive Beings against all those argu·
ments which¹ Ihew that either some one part of it was not

destroy the supposition, “ and therefore, sa s he, they are

the supposition contradicts itself. He goes on “ Det us then

an indffinite flux or aggregate of parts which are continually

infinite, and partly finite but we examin'd this before.

our Souls·, so neither must we deny a litera] Troe of
Knowledge because it had a mystica Sense and lmp'or-.·
tanoe.

And this brings me to the second thing conceming this
Tree, the congruity os God’s applying it to the use men-
tioned in the Text: For the Understanding of which we
must remember that God in all his Intercourses with Men
has constantly made use of some visible or outward Means;
and that it is reasonable it should be so. For since Man
has aBody as well as a Soul; Senses as well as Under·
standing, and that the Soul- does make use os the Organs
of the Body and of the Senses for its information3 and
that this is the natural course of our acquiring Knowledge;
it were a violence to the Nature of Man to invent the
Method‚ or separate the one from the other. And there·
fore God in his Communications with us seems industrious-
ly to have avoided it·, especially where the joyning them
together may contribute to the certainty and effectualness
of the Revelation, and to secure us from being imposed
on by pretenders. Whenever therefore God has shewed
any Miracle‚ he has made use of some outward Aetion to
pyepare the Minds of Men for it, and ascertain them of

the river Jordan to cure his Leprosie. And although God
industrioussy avoided assuming any shape, when he gave
the Law; yet he assured the People os Israel that he was
present by Thunder, Smoke and F ire at Mohnt Sinai, and
by a burning Bush at his first appearance to auses. Nor
did our Saviour go about the public execution of his office,
'till anointed by the Spirit, and vis1bly commiffioned to it
by the Holy Ghost descending on him in a bodily shape:
And thus he still communicares to us the Principles of our
new Birth by Water, and his Body and Blood by Bread
and Wine. Now this being the manner of God’s enter-
taining an intercourse with Man through the whole Serip-

, ture, it is very evident that the two remarkable Trees of

Paradise, that os Life, and this os the Knowledge of Good
and Evil, were designed for these mystieal purposes, and
intended as settled and visible means to supply Man with

God’r

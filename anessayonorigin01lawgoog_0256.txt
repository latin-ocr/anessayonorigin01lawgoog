(1.) That rtis in effen agreed on all 11111111, 1111111111
Nature of God, as it is in itsels, 11 incomprehdnhble by
human Understanding: and not only his Nature, but 11111
wisc his Powers and F aculues and the Ways and Methods
in which he exercises diem, are so far beyond our reach,
that we are utterl yincapable of staming exa& and ade uate

· 510 On the Fan of Man.

was thus with Man in his Innocency; and that he was lit-
tle solicitous about acquiring Knowledge whilst he could
secur to the inexhaustible Stock of God his Parent, and be
supply’d by a free communication from thence on all Oc·
castoris. But when by Sin he cut himself off from that,
and became his own Master to judge what was good and
evil for himself, he then found himself under continual
doubts and Difficulties; he is become senfible of his Igno-
rance ¹and Disability how to determine in the Affairs of Life,
and has no other Affistance than his own Understanding:
This makes him diligent to improve it, and as covetous os
Knowledge as of Money; and so searches sor the treafure
of the one with as rpuch Industry and Pains as of the o
¹ther. Whereas whilst he depended on God only for his
Diredliom he was freed from all that Labour‚ Thirst and
Auxiety wherewith he now rosecutes Knowledge, and was
content with 'the inexhaustible Treasure of Divine Wisdom,
to which he had an easy and ready Access on all Occafiom:
and till we have the like again we can never be happy or
secure. God is the F atherof Spirits, and as a F ather he is
ready to make Provifion forthem, if they will have recourse
to him and depend on him. He is the Light of Souls,‘ and
has the same proportion to them, that the Sun and his
Beams have to the Eye. Whilst we have the use of these,
we know our way and can see about us; But when these
are absent, we are forced to use artificial Lights that can

pleal'ed to impare to our first Parenta in that ‚State of Inno-

, cency, ando which he deprived them for their Sin. This

I suppose may be sufficient to teach us the condition and
Circumstances of Man when that Command in the Text
was given him.

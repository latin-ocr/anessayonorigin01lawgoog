r be more indifferent in respeet os the Objells about Α
which it exercises itsels* To which no one. thing ·

is naturally more agreeable than another, but that ·

will be the sittest to which it shall happen †, to be' ³
applyed: Between which and the Obyeet, to which
it is determined, by it sels or by something else,
ι there should naturally be no more suitableness or
⁴ connection than between it and any other thing; but-
' ’ all the Suitableness there is, should arise from the Aa
plication or Determination itsels. Foras the Earth
is no Man’s Right by nature, but belongs to the
prime Occupant, and the Right arises from that
very Occupation·, so there may possibly be a
Power to which no Objerr is ‚by Nature peculiarly
·, adapted, but ¹ any thing may become suitable to it,

isit happen to be applyed; srnce its Suitableness sm

¹ ceeds from the Application, as we said be ore.
Now it does not seem any more absurd for aPower
. · to create an Agreeableness between itselfand an
Objeu, by applying itsels to that Objeu, or that
. to itsels, than sor aMan to acquire aRight toa
- thing by occupyingJ it. For, asin Civil Laws,
some things are sor idden because they are incon-
venient, others are inconvenient and Evil because
forbidden ; so it may be in Powers, F acuities and
Appetites, viz. ,some may be determined by the
natural Suitableness of the Objecls, and in others,
the Suitableness to the Objecls may arise from the
Α Determination. For this F aculty may be naturally
,· inclined to exercise, and one Exercise be more a·
greeable than another, not from any natural sitness
' qs one more than another, but from the Application

os the F aculty itself 3 since another would often be no ·

less 'agreeable if it had happened to be determined >

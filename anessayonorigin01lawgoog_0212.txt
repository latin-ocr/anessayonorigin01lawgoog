and Vice is still disgracesul. Indeed we can scarce meet with
one, unless pressed by necessity or provoked by injuriet, who
it so barbarous and hard hearted as not to be m'oved with come
passion and delighted with Beneficence to othera3 who is not
'inclined to lhew Gondwill and Kiudness to hit Priends,
Neighbours, Children‚ Relations‚ and diligent in the Discharge
of civil Duties to all; 'who does not profess some regard sor
Virtue, and think himself affronted when heis charged with
Immortality. Is any one take notice ·os 'his own or another'e
Aetione sora Day together, he'll perhaps find one or two
blameable, the rest all innocent and inoffensive. Nay, 'tie
doubtful whether a Nero or Caligula, a Commodus or &rataldo

¹wickedness and F ury) have done more ill than innocent Atti-3

to the Agent. Nero killed a Man that was innocent, but who
knowa whether he did it out of premeditated Malice? Perhaps
some eutrustedwith the care oshis Person, or a slattering
'Courtien whom he is obliged to depend on, informa of this
innocent Man as lottin aconspiracy against the Emperorfe

shch Circumstances very much lessen the Guilt; and it is pro·

the whole Protesi laid open, many things might be offered

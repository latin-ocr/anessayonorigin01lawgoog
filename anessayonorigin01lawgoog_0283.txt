§ XXX. The second Use that I [hail make of this Do·
(trine, is to'put you in mind, how cautious we ought to be

. in our Reaionings and Dedueiions concerning things, of

whose nature we are not sailly appriz’d. 'Tis true, that in

⁸ Matters we fully comprehend, ali is clear and easy to us, and

we readily perceive the eonneaion and Consrstency of all
the Parts: but it is not so in things to which we are in a
great measure 'strangers, , and of which we have only an irrr-
perfeei and partia] view, for in these we are very apt to fancy
contradictione,⁴ and to think the accounts we receive of

³ them absurd. »

The truth of this is manifest from innumerable Instances:
as for example, from the Opinionof the Antz'podes: whiist
the matter was irnperfeffly known, How many Objeetions
were made against it? How many thought they had prov'd

· ·· to a Denronstration the impoffibiiity‘and Contradirstion of

the thing? And how far did they prevail with the genera·
lrty of the World 'to believe them? And yet how weak,

that know, and by experience understand th'e matter?
' Others will say the same concerning the Motion of the

many have undertaken to demonstrate it to be impoffible3
the reason of which is only the imperfeei Knowledge we
have of the thing: And as our understanding' of it is more
,and more enlarg'd and clear’d‚ the Contradieiions vanissi.

,- Ought' we· not then to think ali the Contradietions we
’ fancy between the Fora-knowledge ofGod-and Contingency
of· Events‚ between Predestinarion a‘nci Fra-will, to be the
· Effects of our ‘Ignorance and* partial Knowledge? May it

= ’ not be in this, 'as in the Matter of-ehe· Antipodes, and Mo·

tion of the Earth'i'May no't the' 'Inconfistencies that we
find in the one, be as iil-grounde'd as those that have been
org’d'- against the othere? Andhave we not reason to su-
spect, nay believe'this to he the Caso, srnce we are sure
that we know much less-'of God'and his Attributes, than
of'the -Ear'th and heavenly Motions? ’

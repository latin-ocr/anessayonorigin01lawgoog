(1³9.) He arguesth'at ‘.‘ Infinity is not in itself an actual·

“ addition of finite Spaces, though all the ldea we can get·
.“ conceming it arises from an andless addition of finite Spa-

“ ces, without ever being able to reach to any· End .·”
And then introduces Mr. Locke’s Distinuion between the
inlinity of Space and Space infinite B. a. C. 17. ς 7. .
But if all the Idea we can get concerning this infinity o
space arise purely from an addition of finite Spaces, then¹
must it also confist or be compoled of such Portions of than ‘
same Space, or else ’tis something of which we have auu- ’
ally no Idea at all. Something beyond and befide all our 1..
deas, and inconsistent with the method of acquiring thern:
The Iden of it must be one thing, and itself quite different:
Mr. Locke's Distinenon might one would think convince us*
that this Infinite of his is nota real Metaphystcal one, but

'onlya mere Negation or Non-ens, a bare impollrbility of '

stopping any where; which has nothing to do with that .
¹>other absolute Infinity‚ or rather Perfettion, which belongs
to the Divine Attributes, and all such Qalities as are men-⁸
surable not by Paris, but Degrees: which the same Au-
thor alludes to B. a C. 17. ξ 1. and in the See. immediately
preceeding his Qotation. -
. (Pur.) “Space is the thing containing, and Body is that ·
“which is contained in it: lwould not bc understood by .
“thing to mean a Substance, which seems to be the meam
“ ing of. all those, if they have any meaningm at all, who
“ call Space nothing.’' ⁴

But you must determine this same thing containing to be ’ s

either aSubstance, or a Property‚ or find out a new Distine-

tion for it. Till one of these be done, we are· obliged to .

take it for a mere Enrrntionis, ora fiction of the Mind,' -
conceived indeed (as we laid) by way of Substance, but
which cannot be perfettly reconciled to that or any other·

Categny, nor proved to have a real proper Existence ad ex· ”

tra under any Name or Notion whatsoever. By and by we‘

lhall hear of its having a unstrutam, and some Properties

tm, as well as being its own Snbstratnnn. '
(ltin.) “ How absurd is it to conclude from our being

‘t continually able to add to Space, that Space is really

‘⁴ not infinite? Whereas for this very reason it must riseapiejs-

Give rne leave to add here, that their Argument seems to be
os very little sorce against our Aurios, who urge, that is all
Good and Evil depen upon the Arbitrary Will os God, rhen
ir would not be impoffible sor God to will that Vice be Vir·
tue, that two and two make live,&c. For allowing that
God at first made all things what they are, and still continues
'to them thesaure Existence‚ (though perhaps no reason a priori
can be assigned why he made thern all, or in thir rather
than som‘e other manner) Vice must be Vice, &a charis,
while things are as they are, thelame consequentes and Re·
lationt will result from theme and to suppose the contrary, ie
to suppose that things may be different, or have different con-
segueaeer, while they continue the samer or that they nray be
w at they are and what they are not at the same time. Thoe
all 'the present Relatirns are evidently subsequent to the present
Order os Nature, and must continue with it ; and thre con·

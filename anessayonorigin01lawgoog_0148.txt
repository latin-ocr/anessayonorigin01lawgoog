Laws os Nature; but who will require or allow ³
this to be done frequently? The bounds of this
World, and the number os thinking Brings are
unknown to us, but we believe that the System of
Nature will endure for ever. Now as all things
depend upon the Will of God, we cannot have any 2
other Security of our Happinels, and of 'the Dura· '
tion of the World, than the Divine Constancy and
immutability: the Universal Laws ‚os Nature are
the Affurances' of this Constancy, and upon them,
does the Security and Ha piness of the wholeWork
depend. It is not therelbre to be bxpedied that
God should lightly dispense with* these Laws, rnuch
less alter them by his Omnipotence every Moment.
Since then it is provided by¹ an Universal Law, that
F ree Agents should procure to themselves Happis
ness b the use of Elesiion, and it is irnpoffible but
that tbese, being left to themselves, should some·
φ times sall into depraved Eleslions ; would it not be
an Infringement and a Violation of thissLaw, if

God should interpose and hinder the use of that F a·
cul't'y which by the Law of Nature he had ¹establish-
ed? We don't expedi that the Situation os the

. Earth, or Course of the Sun, lhould be altered on
our account, because these seem to, be things of
great Importance‚ and we apprehend it to be un·
¹reasonable, that for our private Advantage the
, Order and Harmony of things should be changed,
to the detriment of so many Beings. But to alter
the Will, to stop Rhesion, is no less aViolation of
the Laws of Nature, than to interntpt the Course
os the Sun. For a Free Agent is a more noble
Bein than the Sun, the Laws of its Nature are to
be edeemed more sacred, and not to be changed
without a greater Miracle. There would then be
a kind -of Shoek and Violenc'e done to Nature, if
God should interfere and hinder the Amons os F roe-
will, and rhaps' it would prove no less pernici·
uus to the telleciual System, than the Sun's stand-

Choices? lt has been sssewn in the Book what limite are af·

'we should kee' within thern. In short the Argumentis asif

ν one should alledge, a Prince is absolute Governour of bis King-
dom, and must not be controled by his Subjesls, therefore he
needs no Counsellors, because he is not obliged to be deter-
mined by them. But sure the more absolute he is, the more,

need he has to prescribe good Rules to himself, and advise with

the best Counse lors he can sind, becaub he has it in his pow- .

er to rule well, and none is to blame but himself if he do not.
Whereas is he were to be determined by his Counsellors, he
wou’d be under no such concern, since they, nothe, wou'd '

in all reason be answerable sothJis Mistakes.

For ast. Man might be at a loss how to preserve his
Body stom Decays, to which (as was observed before) it

was naturally subject. And adly, how to direct his tte-1 ι
ῐίοηε, For the first of these God appointed the Tree of ,

Life. Not that any Tree by any natural Virtue could pre-
serve us immortal: but since God commanded Man to eat
of it as osten as he needed to be restor'd in his Body, he
surely was ready and able to convey his supernatural As-
. fistance to him by it, and make it effectual to the defign
¹sor which it was appointed. Man’s eating therefore os it
with F aith and in Obedience to God, was the Signa] upon
which the Divine Power was pleas’d to exert itself for the
Restauration of him to his primitive Vigour. ·And there
is no more difficulty to conceive how this should be done, J Ι
·, than how the Israelita 'in the Wilderness should becured

of the Bitings of the venomous Creatores by looking on ¹
the brazen Serpent. Every faithful Christian expects God
should answer his Prayets, and grant him some things,
which he could not have without asking3 and if God ex· κ
ert his Power on our speaking a word, or offering a defire, .
which have no natural Virtue to procure the Effert, he
“ may do the same upon our givinga Si lby some Ac-
tion appointed by him to that purpose. [sill gives his Holy
Spirit to them that ask it according to his Promise, why ,
not to those likewise who in Obedience to his Command ⁴
are baptized in his Name? And if he give Life and lm· ,
mortality now to those that believe and are baptised why
might he not give and preserve Life by means of that
Tree, to the ue of whichhe had promised it, when they ·
iu Faith should eat of it i Now that Life was annexed to
the use of that Tree is plain from Chap. 3. ver. 22. And
noto last ha putforth his hand, and take also of the Tree of
Ia'fe, arrd eat and live sor aver3 therefore the Lord God sent

himsorth from the Garden of Eden. This shews that the ,

restoring os Strength and preservation of Life was annexed
to that Tree by an irrevocable Decree: for the Words
plainly intimate that if Man after his fall, could have con·
tinuod the use of it, he hadkbeen Immortal.

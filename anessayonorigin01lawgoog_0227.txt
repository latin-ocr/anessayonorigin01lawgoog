and we have lhewn that this is the Cale with resp&
to God. lfa Person had his Choice either to abo-

he did not abolilh it. But when the ehoice is be-'
tween this and a greater Evil, he that chooses the less
is far from being malicious. The Divine Goodness
' therefore reduces God to this Difficulty‚ that he
must choose to make either no Creature at all, oran
imperfect one, either no such thing as Matter and
Menon, or tolerate Contrariety and Conuption in
things ; either no free Agent‚ or admit a Power of
linning. He must necessarily have chosen one ol
these, and ’tis easy to say whether of thena was more·

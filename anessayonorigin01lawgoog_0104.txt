Nor secondly‚ will such a Power as this only make us liable
to mistak'e the true Good which is in things (as the Authot of·
the Philosopb. Enquiry and leibnitz argue) but on the contra-
ry, it often makes true Good or Happiness in those things which
of themselves had none at all 3 and improves those things which
have, and alleviates those which have the contrary Qalities;
and os consequence is notan lmpcrscciion, buta very valuable
and neceffary Persestion. Our Authot does not suppose us
lest to an absolute, blind indifference in all Objefls (as Leib-
m'tz often urges) without any Guide orDireetion in the Choice

b'y soine, and informed‘ by his Underllanding of the Nature
and Effefis of others, and so is sufficiently directed to the Choice
of these which are in themselves good and ageeeable to his
Constitution‚ and vice versas yet still with the reserve osa
full Power os following or not following that Guide, of neg-
leciing or refusing that Direflion: Which Power therefore,
. even in these cases, remains still unaffedted. In other Ob-
jefis‚ he lhews that the Man is totally indifferent, which yet,
hyan arbitrary Choice, he can make to be no less constituent
Parts of his Happiness.

Whence, in the ¹third place, a reply may ‘be sonned to the
common Question, What Benestr is there in a Power of choos·

which Enjoyment a Mau could not poflibly have without such
a Liberty‚ but must necessarily hang in perpetual Suspense,
without any Choice at all ε this leibnitz owns to be an una·
voidable consequence of his Opinion ³* and to avoid this Ab·

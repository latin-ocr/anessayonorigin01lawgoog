532 Postscript.

(P.3.) “ Whiteness, says he, is widely different from
“ Space, for 1st all Bodies are not white,’' &a White- ¹
ncss is an abstrasi Idea, which can have noSubsrstance os
ι itsels, and so sar it agrees with pure Extenston, which was
all the agreement between them that was ever intended.

(P.4. 5.6.7.8.) Ihad maintained that to affign positive
Properties to Space was as bad Sense as to apply posr-
tive Propetties to Darkness, Silence, Absence'or mere No-
thing: or in other words, that the three fust, which are
confessedly privativas, might. with equal propriety be said
· to have the properties os receiving Light, Sound, &a as
Space is affirmed to have penetrability, or the Capacity of
receivi Body. He answers by affirming that Space has
’ and miss have the property of receiving ,Body, and then.
proceeds to prove at large that Darlrness is not properly a
Capacity of receivin Light, (which 1 was sofar from as·
serting that I propossd it as a parallel piece os nonsense with
· the former.) The sum of his Argument is this. All Dark-
ness is not capable of receiving Light, he instances in that
Darlrness which is included within the Pores os the Particles
os Ia‘ght itftlf, which must be smaller than a whole Ray
of Light, and consequently no Light at all can get into it.
Were this extraordinary Argument true, it would not prove
his point, viz. that the Darknass as such is ¹inc'apable of
receiving Light, because it affigns an external accidental
impediment in the Case, viz. the interposrtion of the parts
os Matter, or (which comes to the same) minuteness o the
. Pore: But what is still worse, ismatter does not consrst of
certain primogeneal parts, but, as he says, os such as ‘are
“ so very small, that were we to suppose them never so small,
“ wc may yet suppose them smaller,'' p. 6. Then will there
be no cavity so minute but that we may suppose a particle
of Light commensurable to it. Lastly this Argument
would prove equally against Space itsels·, and were Idis-
posed to be pleasant, Ι might argue that the Space sup·
posed to be within these same Cavities is no Space, because ’
it has not the property os receiving Body, i. e. 'tis too small
to admit any kind of Body. . ⁵

But I shall readily be excused sor dropping this Po'int.H ·

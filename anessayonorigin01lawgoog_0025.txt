(48.) Farther, if the Mind can snspend the Satissaflion of
any urgent defrre (which Mr. anke allows ⁴* and therein
places all its Liberty) then it can as easrly quite stop, or run
counter to any natural Appetites frnce no greater Power seems
to be requifrte for theone than fur the other. lf we can hin-
der the Will from being determined by any desire uf absent
Good without any appearance os greater Gnod on the other
. Side, which might raife an opposrte desrte able to counterbal-
lance it, as our Author has shewn that we can 3 then we shall
be equally able to prevent its following the ultimate determi-
nation of ‘the Judgment, even without any reason for fo do-

asundetermined, and indifferent towards Volitiun, as Mr.

neither the adequate efficient Cause, nor a necelfary Means to,

then it will be difficult to make it free in any fense. Let us
obferve how Mr. Locke endeavours to reconcile thefe two No„
tiuns together. Our Liberty, according to him, is founded
in a general absolute Inclination uf the Mind to Happiness,
which obliges us to suspend theGratificatiun of our Desrre in
particular cases, till we see whether it be not inconfistent with
the general Gonu. “The strunger Ties, says he, Sesl. 51-

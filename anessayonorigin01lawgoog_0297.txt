508 Ι ·On the Fall ffMan.

, of every Trea in the Garden thou mayst freeh eat. This seems
. added, because these Trees of Paradise were not planted

when God made the Revelation of the first Chapter: And
therefore it might be doubted whether the were intended
for the Food of Man, or given him by efonner Reve-
lation, ifGod had not expressy declared it.

Now is a Man was not to seed himself before he had
God’s Direffion sor it, which saved him the trouble and
hazard of finding out by Trials what was fit fot· hima
It is reasonable to believe that in every Affair of Life he
was to depend on the same Diredlion3 that he was not
to assume to himself that Knowledge os Good and Evil,
that is, of what was profitable or hurtful to him, but en.
tirely to depend on God for the Determination thereof‚· and
whilst he did so, he could 'never know Evss, because God
would always diro& him to what was Good‚ and to that
r ll is to be considered that Man by his Constitution was

Mortal, and subjeft to the Impreffions of the Bodies that
surrounded him ς for being composed of the Elementa as
to his material Part, in which he resembled other living
Creatures, those might be separated and dissolved, and the
separation of the Pares of. our Body infers Death. And
therefore Man in his natural Composrtion was subjeet to it;
but yet was capable of Immortality, to which' he could not
be intitled but from a supernatural Principlet and the pecu·
liar Care of God For it was impofflble that Man’s Un-
derstanding how great soever, should be so perfect as to en·
able him of himself to know and avoid all those things that
might occasion a Decay and Dissolution of his Body. Only
God’s Knowle eould reach this ; and therefore it is ma·
nifest he must epend on that·, and on all occafions have
recourse to it, if he expeded to continue Immortal.

Nor 4thly, Was his being obliged to such dependance a
to be looked on as a Defen, but rather a most signal Fa·
vour. l observed before, that he deperded on the Air for
Breath, on the Sun for Warmth‚ and on the Earth for
Food; And yet none of these could be teckon'd an Im-
petseetion3 How much less could his Dependance on his

Creator

to allow thie same ries, whether it be dependent orinda-

ceffardy prior in the order os our Ideas, is for that reason
prior also in the order of Nature, if we have any knowledge
at all of Nature: or can prove any thing from our ideas
concerning it. Every mover must be previous to the moveas
aa well in Nature as in idea, though it cou’d not be pro-
perly a mover till it produced some motion. in like mans
ner as the Sun could not be what we now stile Sun till· it
emitted light, but yet the matter of it, as well ae the mo·'
tion excited in its parts, must be previous (except you will
suppose it sess motive) both in Nature an'd Time to the astu-
al Emisfion os these parts whichcause the idea of Light,
and which require some time for every Motion: i. etheit
Motion is not instauramus, and consequentiy Light, which
iethe effen thereos, cannot be strictly coetaneous with the
Suri. Your F ather was no Fathrr'indeed till he hod a son,

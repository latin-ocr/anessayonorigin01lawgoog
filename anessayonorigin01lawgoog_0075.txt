lt thie Objefiion prove any thing it proves that before Reve-
htion what we now call vicen were 33313, since 33 that
time there war no way to *distinguiIh vicinus from virtuous Ac· ,
31333, bnt by observing which burt, or help'd Mankind, one
31 which Nature tau ht him to cultivate, and to avoid the

, · other. But 11 theA 'ons we call vicione (suchat rnnrther‚

lust, injustice, contem 331 God and Irreligion) did 3ο hort, Ι
there was no reason en ibonld be debarr’d frorn them or God

· ,be imagin’d to forbid thenr, before he declar’d his Wlll to that
ν pur fe. But adly, it ie a plain cafe that these and all other

wic ed and irreligione 31111333 do mischief to mankind, and

have 3 delirnfiive influente according 33 their number, and if
all Men nond give themselves u to thern without restraint,
Mankind could not subsrst. 11 clf-murder were universal,
there were 33 end 31 human rate: 11 none won'd take care of
children, one A e would uta period to the Species. If all
were false, treacherone 33 cruel, Life wonldlbe ssnort and
comforclefa3 if there we're no arnity, society and jonicae

would have the same Effen. If Lust and unnatural Mixturea

· were pradised as oft 33 Opportunityoffer'd; 11 drunkennese,

‚from these in such 3 Degree, that our Livee are

intem rauce and excesu were indulffi’d to the utmoil, most

wo starve, and the rest livea ort uneasy nise. Thie'

· ainly sstews that these Vires are contrary to the Nature of

, ankind, and therefore God who gave that Nature har clear· ·
ly enough fignified that they are oontrary to his Will. It mult
‚be eonfefs’d indeed that there is much vice and wickednefs in
v,the World, and it ie proyrortionably miserabler but yet take the
Atliona 31 the worst o Men, and you will find ten innocent,

' for one thatin criminal or rnifchievona. For the trutb of

thie 1 appeal to common Experience. Let any reekon the
Ans 31 any one Man from Morning to Night, and he will

¹liud the Proportion hold; and this is much more observabit if

we take the whole Life of a Man together; the proportion of

innocent aere to the vicinus willa pear much greater; Child·
ἱ hood and old Age bein 'much 11333 from mifcbievoue aas
than the middle part of hire.

But lastly, Itis nrg'd that 11 these things be contrary to the
Willof God, he ought not only to have forbid them, but
taken effefiual Care that they fhould not be prafiifed.

Ianswer, God har taken effenual Care to yreserve Men

33 ir expedient 133 the good of the whole. Thhurlei‘hahdefhrf

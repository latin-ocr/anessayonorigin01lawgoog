seo. 5. Sub. 6. 'OsMoral Evit' 419

But yet both natural and moral corruptnn have
their Bounds, neither does God permit them to
spread farther than is conducive to the Good of the
whole *. It may seem strange to us that he suffers
both os them to wander over this World of oure
without Restraint, hut what is our World to the
whole System of the Universe? How final] a Part!
how next to nothing! Let this whole Earth of
ours be stainod with corruption os both kinds, .
suppose it clouded 3ηά beni hted with Darkness
and Vice, yet it will be but like a very finallS
in avery beautiful Body, which is so far from d-
sening, 'that it cncreases the Comeliness 3ηά Beauty
of the whole. The Earth notwithstanding its Ob-
scurity, has its Use and Place in Nature, which it ,
“ could not commodioussy fill if those things which
render it liable to Darkness and 0⁰¹³? tion were
removed. The same must be said of en, they
have their proper Use and station, and in order to
fill it commodioussy, they were to be created of
such a Nature and Disposition as might eafily be
corrupted with Vice. Ncither have we any more
reason to conclude that all free Agenrs are involved
in Evil Elediions, because this happens almost uni-
versally to Men, than that all the Regions of the
Hecvent are subject to thelame Changes that our
Ait is liable to. The whole work oi God may
be bright and beautiful, tho’ that Point which con· ,
stitutes our World seem by itself rude and una-
domed ε’ and tho’ some Patts appear to us, who have
not 3 View of the whole Contentum, larger or
less than the just Proportion requires, yet they may
ml xstitit,stththhdhhll
and Goodness in the Moral, any more than in the
Natural World. The Crimes 3ηά Vices themselves

are very few in comparison of the free rigenti,

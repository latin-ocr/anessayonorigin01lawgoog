We aseri Decrees and Predestination to (heda &musetha

our F ote-knowledge and Decrees) are lbi isthe same Ab

locity, are Subjeehs of ve useful Knowledge3 and that ad.-
justing and discovering t eProportions that these bear to
one another, is perhaps all that is profitable in nattual Phi·
losephy. How is it then, that we proceed in our Danaa
ibations concerning these? Is it not by representiuffie'fimr
by a Line, the Degrees os Velocity by anodur, and Mo
tion that results from both, by a superficies or aSolid?
And from these we draw Conclusrons, which are not only

very true, but also of great Manent to Arta and δΰὶᾰὶεὲἅ

among things not sufficiently known, our Errors

are not to be charged upon us, nor is it credible ·,

that God will suffer them'to prove fatal¹ to us. But

when we are-under no manner of Neceiirty, an E-

lection often presente itfelf to usin Matters suffi-

ciently understood, and theu we hurty on without a

stri& and carefol Enquiry, and choose impossibili-

ties‚ &a and therefore are not entirely free from ἱ
Fault‚ 'smce we ought to deliberate and examine f
things before Eledlion. , .

ΙΙΙ. Secondly, These undue Eledlions therefore secondly,
may happen thro’ Inadvertency, for by due Care we ny Negli-
might rceive the Good and Evil which is in Ob· genre.
jedlsr ut being negligent and supine, we are fre-
quently imposod upon, and suffer for our Negli-
gence, by falling into the forementioned inconveni⁴
encres. ,

be unfortunate in the Event·, but this is no Excuse3

for every one is obliged to take care of himself, lest

he be too fond of indulging new Eledions‚ and

from Levity become unduely troublesome to him-

self or others. >

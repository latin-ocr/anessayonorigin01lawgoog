the Absent, much less those that live in distant l'o
which there need no other answer, than to inform ’ hat
there are other sort of Words‚ beside those he knows, rhr
are truly called so, because equivalent to¹ such aa arespoleua
that they have both the same use, and serve to
communicate our Thoughts to one another, thetis
he will but have patience, and apply himself to lenuit
will soon understand, and be convinced of the Poffibility
and Usefiuner‘s of the thing: Androne can doubt buthe
were much to blame, and alled an unwise part, ifhe rt·
fused to believe the Person that offered to ittstrust him, tt
neglested to make the Experiment

And sure, when any one objelis against the Pollibility
of the Three l'ersons os the Trinity in one God, it is every
whit as good an Auswer to tell such an Objettor that thee
are other sort os Persons besides those we see among
Men, whose Personality is as truly different from what we
call so, as aWord written is different from aWord spoken,
and yet equivalent to it. And though three Persona, such
as Men are, can’t be in one human Nature, as a Word
spoken caa't be vihble and permanent: yet what we call
three Persona by Comparison and Analogy, may confistin
the Unity of the Godhead.

And after the same manner we ought to answer those
who object against the F ore-knowledge and Decroes of God,
as inconfistcnt with the Freedorn os Choice‚ by tellingtbem
that though such Fore-knowledge and Dectees as aneia
our Understanding and Wills, cannot consrst with Contin-
gency, if we suppose thern certain : yet what we call soin
God may, being quite osa different Nature, and only
called by those Names, by reason of some Analogy and
Proportion which is between them.

And if Men will but have patience, and wait the proptr
time, when Faith shall be persee'ted into Vision, arrd we
ssrall know even as we are known ·, they may theu see aad
be as well satisfied that there is uo Absurdity in the Tri·
nity os Persona, or F ore-knowledge of Contingency, as thr
Indiae is, when he has leamed to read and write, that there

is no irnpoffibility iu visrble and permanent words. §m

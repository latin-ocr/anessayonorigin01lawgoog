ι, hm? let hhnsuhhhse tehhtea h'hah has lived happily many
Years, and at length falling ,jnto some great Misfortune or grie·
vous Pain dispatche's himself. This does not prove that he
thinks the Life God hath given no beneht, or worse thau
Death ς but only that the small and misgrablp part which re-
mains to hini is not worth the living. A Man has aVefl'el o!
good Wine which he drinhs with Pleasute to ὥς Dr'ega, theh
throws them out. <Wi11 any. one conptudqssrom then'ce th'a't
the Man thinks a Vessel oijneho valuahle preseh't? An'd yet
this isexahly the ease of such Selhmurderers.

From the wholel think it manifest that Life, such as ig is,
isa valuable Good, and consequently fit to beg ,bestowed -on
us by a good God. As, it has mdre Good· thau Evil in ik.
’tis plain¹ we are obliged to him that 'gave it; and it is ἐ
{cry wicked and ungrat'eful thing for any one to pretend the

ontrary.

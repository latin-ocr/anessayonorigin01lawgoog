. On ,the Fall of Mala, 52 5 .
The ad. part of God’s Sentence against Man, is the

Condemnation of him to temporal Death, v. 1⁸9. ofCh. 3.
For Dust thou art, and unta Dust thou shalt return. It was
observed before that Man by his natural Constitution was
Mortal, and that it was only by the especial Favour of God,
that he was preserved from Death. Since therefore he had ·
forfeited that Favour, he mustos course smk into his na-
tive mortality. It was not necessary that God lhould alter
his Nature or Constitution to make him Mortal, there
> needed no more but taking away the means of Immortality,
the use of the Treeof Life, to subject him to Death·, and ,
the use of it was no ways due to his Nature: God there·
fore did him no Injustice by depriving him and his Poster-
ity of Paradise and the use of the Tree of Life, these being
matters of Favour, and we intitled to them only on this

condition, that our first Parents lhould continue in Obe-
dience to God. This withdrawing of God’s Favour is a

great and dreadful Punilhment, but far from lnjuffice, be· ’

cause it takes nothing from us that was due 'to our Nature,
and leaves us still in a condition preferable to not being at ,
all, which is as much as God in strictness of Justice is o·
bliged to do for any Creature. Thus we find ourselves sub
jeded to the Displeasure and Wrath of God by our descent
from Adam, *so far‘as to prevail with God to withdraw
· frona us his peculiar F avours that he defigned for us, if our
first Parents had continued in their Obedience, the conse-
quence of which is that we become subject to Pains and
Miseries, to Sickness and temporal Death.

But adly. The Souls of Men are immortal, and capable .
of Misery or Happiness after' this Life, and the Trans- μ
greffion ol Adam does likewise affe& them, and they be- ,
come liable to Danmation on account thereos. It seems in·
dee'd hard that God’s Anger ihould reach so far as to de· x

rive all Mankind of eternal Happinels for the Sin of one,
but if we confidet Man as a free Agent, we shall find that
eternal Happiness is not absolutely due to him, but only

the poffibility thereos τ and if God has not deprived us of ·

that poffibility, he has done us no Iny'ustice. And it ap-
pears from the very History of Man’s F all, that God has
not done that: for he has entered into new Ternas of Sal-

Ll ' vat'ton ·

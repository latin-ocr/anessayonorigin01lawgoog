.· Concerning the Tree of Knowledge ,os Good and Eril
here mentioned, Let us obserwe rst. that it wan a true li·

teral Tree, and that we are not to be put off with a meer ,

F igure. For it is said, v. 9. of the Chapter. And out of
the Ground made the Lord Gal ro grou) every Tree that is
pleasant to the Sipha, andgoodfor Foad, theTree ofLife¹ also f
in the midst of the Garden, aad the Tree ofKnowledge ofGood
> and Evil. If the Trees for hght and food were true literas
TreeS, then so likewise were the Trees of Life and Know-
ledge, sor both are equally said to grow out of the
Ground.. And when God 'in the Text allows Man to eat ,
os the other Trees, he forbids him on pain of Death to eat
of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Now
to understand eating and Ἰ raes literally in one part of the
Text, and figuratively in the other, when there is no inti-
mation or ground for a different Sense, is incongruous to
reason. No! it will be plain to any one that considers
the design of Moses, that he is giving us here the literal
History of the Creation os the World, of the Maldng and

Fall of Man, and not an Allegory. But because this does
not suit with the Notions os some Men, to whom the Scrip- ’
ture in the literal Sense seems not sufficiently spiritual, t

therefore they endeavour to allegoriae the Historyo
Fall, but might with equal reason turn his Creation and

that of the World into a F igure. And it is observable
that the same Persons that put a figurative Sense on· the
Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, and on the manner
os Man's becoming liable to· Death, as the Scriptores deli·
v'er it·, do the same with the Methods God has appointed
sor our Recovery, and deny not only the litera] Sacramenta,
but likewise the Rehrrearon os the same Body, the Power
of the liternl Death os Christ and the satisfaction ur·
chased by it. But we must not separate the literal riom
the mysticas Sense, as we must not deny the Baptism os
Water, because we acknowledge that of the Spirit, nor -
the Resurreaion os our Bodies because we own another of

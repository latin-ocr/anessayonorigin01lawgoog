¹484 Furi-knottledge consistent tuith*

§.xvsti l might go through all the Notices we have
of natural Things, and shew that we only know and dis-
tinguilh them by the Effecit they produce- on our Senses,
and make you senstble that such Knowledge sufficiently
serves the Purposes of Life. And no Reason can be given
why the Reprelentations given us in Scripture of God and
divine ‘Thinga though they do only shew us the Effatts
that proceed from them, should not be sufficient to anfwet
thePurposcs of Religion. , · -

Particularly we ascribe F ore-knowledge to God, because
we 'are certain that he cannot be surprized by any Event,
nor be at any loss what he is todo when it happens. And
thereby we give him all the Perfettion we can, and assurt:
ourselves that we cannot deceive him. - ¹

After the same manner we ascribe Predestination to him,
and conceive him as predetermining every thi that comes
to pass, because all his Works are aa steddy ahdcertain, as
if he had predetermined thein after the same manner that
wisc Men do theiis. - · · .

We farther represent him as absolutely free, and all his ·
actions as aristng only from himself, without any other
· Confideration but that of his own Will; because we are
fure, the Obligations we owe to him are as great 33 ifhe ,
acted in this wise. We are as much obliged to magnisy his
free Mercy 3ηά F avour to us, to humble our Minds before
him, and return our tribute os Gratitude to him, as. if our
Salvation intirely proceeded from his mere Good-will and

b XIX. Let me in the fourth Place observe, that as we
transfer tlte Actions of our own blinda, our Powers, and
Virtues, by analogy to God, and ,speak of him as if he had
the like ·, so we proceed the same way in the Representutions
we make to one another os the Aetions os our Minds, and
ascribe the Powers and Faculties of Bodies to the-Transac-
tions that pass in them. Thus. to weigh things, to penetrate,
t0 rellesi, nreproper Actions of Bodies, which we transfer
to our Understanding's, and commonly say, that the Mind
weighs or penetratas thingS, that it tellecta un isself, or

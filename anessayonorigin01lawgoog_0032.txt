nothing Good in regard to this Powet, at least in

those Objefls to which it is indifferent, till it has
embraced it, nor'Evil till it has rejected it: Since “ ’
'then the Deterrnination os the Power to the Objesi

is prior to the Goodness and the Cause of it, this
Power cannot be determined by that Goodness in '

its Operations.

y Vl. Fisthly, Such aPower as this, if it be grant· Nor by
ed to exist, cannot be determined by any meast-wlfr·
mss an'fing from the things about which it is con· “fil‘s‘·
versant. for it is supposed to be indifferent, not
only in respedi of external Objefts, but also of its'¹
own Operatione, and will please itsels, whether it

accepts the thing onre'efis it3 whether it exerts ,
thie Au or another. These Objefis then will nei-
ther pleasc nor displease till this indifference be re-·
moved; but it is supposed to be removed by the
Application or Determrnation os the Power itself;
therefore Anxiety does not produce but pre-sup-
pose its Determination.· Let us suppose this Power
to be· already determined (it matters not how) to
embrace a certain Objeft, or to exert the proper

Affions relating to it, Destre manifestly follows this
Determination, and Desrre is followed by an En-
deavour to pbtain and en‘oy the Objest pursuant
to the Application os the {lowen But¹ is any thing
,should hinder or stop this endeavour, and prevent
the Power from exerting those Operatione whichit
undertook to discharge in relation to the' Objest,
then indeed Uneasrness would arise from the hin-
dranceos the Power. Anxiety would therefore be ,
the' Effer? of the Deternrinationus this. rever, but
by nomeane thessaase of in* VH*

nonus.

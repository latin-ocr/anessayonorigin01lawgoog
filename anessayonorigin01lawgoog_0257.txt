that they have Effecit like unto those that do proceed from
Wisdom, Understanding, and F ore-knowledge in us r And
when our Works fail to resemble them in any particular,
aa to Perfedion, it is by reason of some want or dese& in

to God, by way of resemblance and analogy to such Qra· '
lities or Powers as we find most valuable and perfect in

' ourselves.

§V. (3.) Is we look into the holy Scri tures, and eon·
fider the Representations given us there olGod or his At*
tributes, we shall lind them generally os the same nature,
and plainly borrowed from some resemblance to things with
. which we are ac ‘trainted by our Senses. Thus when the
holy Scriptores lpeak of God, they ascribe Hands,- and
Eyes, and Feet to him ε· Not that it ia desrgned we should
believe that he has any of these Members according to the
literal signification: but the meaning is, that he has 3
Power to execute all those Asis, to the effecling of which
these Parts in us are instrumental: That is, he can con·
verse with Men as well as if he had a Tongue and Mouth;
he can discern 311 that we do or say as perfcffly as is he
had Eyea and Ears·, he can reach us as well as if he had
Hands and Feet; he hat as true and substantial aBeing
as if he had a Body; and he is as truly present every
where as if that Body were infinitely extended. And in
truth, if all these things which are thus ascribed to him,
did really and literally belong to him, he could n'ot do
what he does near so effeslually as we conceive and are sure
he doth them by the Faculties and Properties which he
really possesses, though what they are in themselves be un·
known to us.

After the same manner, and for the same reason, we
smd him represented as affected with such Paffrons as we

perceive

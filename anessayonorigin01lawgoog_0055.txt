llrnow 'tiegur that where there is no external motive to
determine the ill, there only chance must do it, which ia¹ to
admit an effesi withouta Cause. ltanswen that it is the Nature
ose sreeA ent to be the Cause os itruwn Actione, without
being inrpefi’d by any thing without irsels. The choolin'g a·
thing givet it the goodnest to thie‘ being, and rt choosea atv
thing, not because rt was antecedently an Objesl apt to ylease
it, but because it intende to reale it so. When it is obyesled
that such an h chodsee without reason, 1 answer, itsels ie
the reason to it els os ita atlingr that ia, it asir to exercise its
Faculties, tlre exercise os which causer tbe Sense os Pleasuree
and where there are several wayr os exercisng itt Facultiee
aud all indifferent, to show the Dominion over its own Asilone,
that is itt Liberty, it tricet the way it chooses anor ia it rea·
sonable to expeti itthotsld lie idle till it ind a Reason why it
hould ael one way rather than another, when in trutlr there ie
no such Reason, the Oby'edle being to the Agent absolutely in·-
different rand therefore amongfl infinite poshble Worlds, there 2
war no Reason possible or imaginable to determine God to.
ruake thia rather thau any other, beside hie Will a he chose it„
and therefore it lenset hinr, and he may destroy it when he
will, and that willlilrewise please him. · ·

Is it be assr'd‚ ia there then nothing Good or Evil in res ἃ
os God? 1 answer there is, oie. the asle-oshit own iila
they please hinr, and whild that Will continues, every thing
which crossen it, or tenda that way, it Evil or displeasing to
hirn. Thus it it hia Will that we should have Freedonr of
choice in many thingrr and he has set certain limite toour
Choice to prevent our herting ourselnes or others by chooszng
arnist. Theresore it would be contrary to our Nature to take
away the use os iret-will from uer and fince it is his will to
gire us such a Nature, 'tit likewise hir will to continue the
use os our Freedonr: lt would likewise be contrary to the Will
os God sor us to use our F reedorn to nrischieve ourselves or o-
thers, and therefore we conceive that ever one who thus unis·
uses his Freedotn incu'rs the displeasure os od.

But then ’tis plain that in all asir which we conceive to be .
pieafing or displeasrng to the Deity‚ we derive the Reason os
their being o from the consideration os their agreeableness or

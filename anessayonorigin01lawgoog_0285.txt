496 Fore-knowledge rorfislent with ’

examine: l shall only add, that if God’s Fore-knowledge
were exaffly conformable to ours, the consequence would
seem just; but inasmuch as they are of as different a na·
ture as any two Faculties os our Souls, it doth not follow
(because our foresrght of Events, ifwe suppose it infallible,
must presuppose a Neceffity in them) that therefore the di·
vine Prescience must require the same Necellity in order to
its being certain. Itis true, we call God's Fure-knowledge
and our own by the same Name; but this is not from any
real likeness in the Nature of the F aculties, but stom some
proportion observable in the Effeets of them : Both having
this advantage, that they prevent any surprize on the Per·
son endow'd with them. ’ y -

Now as it is true, that no Contingency or Freedom in
the Creatures, can any way deceive or surprize God,
ut him to a loss, or oblige him to alter his Measures:
loon the other hand it is likewise true, that the divine
Prescience doth not hinder F reedom ς and athin may ei-
ther be or not be, notwithstandin that For glrt of it
which we ascribe to God. When erefore it is alledged
that if God foresees 1 ssrall be saved, my Salvation is infal-
lible‚ this doth not follow ς because the Fore-knowledge of
· God is not like Man’s, which requires Neceffity in the E·
vent‚ in order to its being certain, but os another Nature
consulent with Contingency: And our inability to com-
prehend this arises from our ignorance of the true Nature

of what we call Fore-knowled e in God. And it is as im·
possible we should comprehend the Power thereos, or the

manner of its Operation, as that the Eye should seca
Sound, or the Far hear Light and Colours.

Only of this we are sure, that in this it differs from oure,
that it may consist either with the being or not 'being os
what is said to be foreseen or predestinated. ¹Thus St. Paul
was a chosen Veffel, and he reckons himself in the number
of the predestinated, preſs 1. 5. Having predestinata ur to

the adoption of Children by Jestts Christ to himself. And yet
he supposes it possible for him to miss of salvation: And

therefore he look’d on himself as obliged touse Mortifica-
tion, and exercise all other Graces, in order to madal] 1}ng

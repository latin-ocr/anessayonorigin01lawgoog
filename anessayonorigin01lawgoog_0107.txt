brought to prove that a neceffitated choice may plesse us. Yet
to slrew how strangely some Authors can wander from the
point, Iwill examine one or two os them. first, it is said, is
a Man should upon mature Deliberation resolve on a thing,

follows that and succeeds, he would conceive an extraordinary

Fortune bad promptcd him to do it, and there ore it is nothis
Choice that pleases him.

I answer·,· Finit, it is plain such a Man alters his Choice,

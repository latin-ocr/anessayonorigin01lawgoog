Power is determined by that very asi: and no less
force is requifite to suspend than to exert the adl, as
common Sense and Experience may inform any
- one* A determination then abouta thing once
, proposed to be done, is unavoidable3 and smce it
can neither be detennined by any Good or Evil
pre-exilient in the Objests, nor by the natural
Powers or Appetites, nor by theIr Objesis3 it
must of necessity either continue undeterminod‚ or⁴
else determine itself. Eut though it be naturally free
from any determination, yet the Nature of the thing
requires that it should be determined on every par·
ticular occafion, and fince there is nothing exter-
nal to do this, it remaihs that it determine itself.
We shall call this Determinati0n an Elaean, for
as ¹it is naturally indifferent to many things, it will
please itself in elesiing one before another.

mined by determines it to an Elestion? For if any such thing

himself,

and things were supposed, it would not be indifferent, i. a. 'tis

arenot contrary to the Nature of this Agent that there

which is to rnake an Objeet agreeable to itself, i. e.
good, by its own proper asi. For here the Good-
ness of the Objeat does not precede the asi of E·
·leetion, so as to excite it, but Fleslion makes the
Goodness in the Objeu·, that is, the thing is agree-
able because chosen, and not chosen because agree-

able : We cannot therefore justly enquire after any

other cause of Eledion than the Power itsels. .

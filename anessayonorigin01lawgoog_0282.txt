make of it, is to call to mind 'what Duty and 'Submillion
we ought to pay to one who may thus deal with us if he
please, and what Gratitude we ought to retum him, for

eleeting and decreeing us to Salvation‚ when he lay under
no manner of Obligation to vouchsafe us that F avour.

Again, when we find him represented as a gracious and ·

merciful Father, that treats us as Children, that is sollicitous
for our welfare, that would not our Death or Destruttiom
that has done all things for our eternal Happiness, which ’
could be done without violating the Laws of our Creation,

We make no scruple to acknowledge, that Love and Ha·

God, not that they are in him, as we conceive thern, but
to teaeh us how we are to behnve ourselves toward him, and
what Treatment we may expett at his hands. And if so,
why lhould we make any difficulty to think that Fore--
knowledge, Purposes, aharons, and Decrees are attributed to ’

him after the s ane way, app to the same intenti §XXX

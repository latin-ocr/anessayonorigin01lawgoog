⁵ On the Fall of Mars„ 515

and that in order to confer that Grace there ought tube ’
some obvious means, easy to be known and ready to bc'
used. And perhaps it will be hardto think of· any other
way so suitable as this which God chose. Foris some outa
ward means ought to be used, this restraining him from the
use of one of the Trees seems the most proper: some such
Synnbol seems not only reasonable but necessary3 and sood
being the only thing he needed, and that provided for him
out of the fruits of the Earth, the lnstance' could not be so
proper in any other matter.

3dly. We must remember that Man was created a free
Agent‚ and it is the Nature of such to be pleas’d with no· ’
thiu that is not agreeable to their choice. The best* and

care that you shall not choose amiss in any thing else. Your “
obedience in this shall be an infallible meansto secure you
from choosmg wrong in any other thing. Whilst you use
your F ree-Will right in this, l will take care that you shall
not abuse iton any other occaslon. Some instance of your ι
free Obedience is necessary: And this is the most easy that
could be provided for'you. But by your wrong use os F ree-
Will here, you will open aGate sor Sin and Death to enter.

trary tryal of submisllon to the Will of God 3 ¹ but rather as

a means to facilitate and secure the Obedience we owe him. ·

When Chrast sont the blind Man rothe Waters of Siloam
for opening his Eyes‚ no-body will say that that Command

was a meer' tryal‘os his obedience, but rather a means to
restore his Slght. 'And so when God commanded Man

here not to eat of the Trigoy Knowledge‚ &ct · That Abstiss·

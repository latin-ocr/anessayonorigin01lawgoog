that' are unacquainted with stach'Matters, would pass for ¹
Connadictions. As sor example, let us suppose one should

happen to mention Negotioe Quantities among Persons

· 'strangers to the Mathematicks; and being ask'd what

is 'meant by 'those Wordssnould answer, 'l'hat he under-

stands by them Qantitt'es that are conceived to be less than

Nothing, and that one os their Propertio is that being ,
multiplied by a Nulnber less than Nothing, the Produst
may be· a Magnitude greater than any assign'd. This might
justly ‚appear a Riddle, and full of Contradictions, and
perhaps will do so to a great part os my Auditors. Some-
thing less than Nothing, in appearance is a Contradistion3
a Number less than Nothing, has the saone sace: That these
should be multipliable on one another, sounds very oddly;
-and that the Produo of less than Nothing upon less than
Nothing, should be positive, and greater than any affign'd
Qantities, seems inconceivable. And yet, if the inosti -
, norant will but have patience, and apply themselves thr >

Instruction to the slcilful in theseMatters they will soon ι

find all the' seeming Contradictions vanish, and that the
¹Assertions are not only certain, but plain and 'easy Truths,
that may be conceiv'd without anygreat difficulty.

Ought we not then to suspest our own Ignorance, when
we fancy Contradistions ¹in the Descriptions given us of the ,
Mystenes of our F aith and Religion? and ought we not to
¹wait with Patience, till we come to* Heaven, the proper
School where 'these things are to be learned? And in the
mean tirne, aquiesce in that Light the holy Spirit -has gi· .
venus in the scripturos, which, as Ι have lhew’d, is suffi-
cient to dire& us in our present Circumstances.

§XXXIL The third use l shall make of this Doctrina,
is to teach us what answer we are to give that Argument
'that has puzzled Mankind, and done so much mischief in

'in the World. It runs thus: “ lf ¹God soresee or predesti- ¹

‘¹ nate that l shall be saved, Ishall infallibly be so·, and if
'⁸‘ he foresee or have predellinated that 1 shall be damned,
Δ “it is unavoidable. And therefore it is no matter what l ·

svers have been given -to this, which I shall not at present
⁴ ia examine:

Of Mora! Euil. Chapel‘t

V 111. We must take the third of tlrose' 1011οΒ1011-
ekes of his knotty Argument3 viz. That God nei-
ther will nor can remove Evils. (84.) Yet we deny
the Consequence. He is neither tube esteemed
Envious nor Impotent because he does not work
contradictions: But it is acontradittion that all
Evils lhould be removed, without removing the

hy the terror of such Exanimes, it would 11111 be agreeableto,
Goodnesr to suffer them to make the choice and feel the Effetlr
01 it. ’

Methinlts the Cale thus stated doth much better represent the
circumstances 01 God’t permitting Sin, than as the Objefflou,
puts it. For 1 have already lhewed that God has created at
many indefeuible Beingt (if any such be pollible‚ which it'

r indeed ,cry doubtful) ae this or any system 01 the World will

allow : that he has placed as many 01 the Beingr that are ca·
pable 01 defection in Places and Circumhances that will secure
them t'rom Temptation‚ as there was room for, in this or any
other poffible Model 01 the Creation. That efter these mort
perfeci lleings were created, and these more secure places filled,
there was 11111 room for many Creatures 01 other ¹sorte, enti
that many such were poffible, but all with a Capacit 01 choos·
ing ill, and the inconveniency 01 Temptations r an that there
was no other way to secure them all from inconvenientes, but
either by not making them at all, or not allowing them the
Ι010 01 their Faculties, or lastly changing their Nature into
another sort than the System 01 Creatures would allow. ln .
this case the Questions are, whether it was better and a greater
lnllance of Goodness in God to condescend to give these im- ’
perfect Creatures a Being‚ and to dispenle with their imper· ’

-1οἂ1000; ot to deny i't to them? adly, Whether it was greater

‘Goodness in him to give all his Creaturesa free use 01 their
Liberty, which is the greatest pleasure of a rational Creaturt,
and without which they cannot havea lull Enjoyment 01

themselves, though he foresaw one in many Millione would

abuse it ; or to deber the whole from such a Satisfafflon? Esss
petially when the Mislortune 01 that one secured the restes
those many Milliont ’ .

(84.) Leilm'tz would rather say, “ that God could take then
“ away, but he was not willing to do it absolutely; and fot
“ a very good reason, &cause he lhould have taken away the

ἕ( Good at the same' time, and because ht lhuuld have “ken
ξ’ away ruore Good than Evil [o.]” ’

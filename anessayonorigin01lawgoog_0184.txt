He that understands that manner rightly will never ,
stick at this Difficulty. Α

The Reader may observe, that in this and other
Places, I intersperse some things which belong to
Raveoled Religion, contrary· to what Ι intended at
first; which happened because some objections leem-
ed to arise from revealed· Religion, in oppolition to
the Principles and Argumenta here laid down. Since
therefore 1 had determined to produce nothing but

what was perfeffly agreeable to theArticles of Faith, t · 1

and the Principles ol the Christian Religion, 1 found ··,
it necellary to call in the Scriyture to my Alirstance, .

that the Answer might come rom the farne Qrarter
with the Objedlions. ’

One that knows nothing of Revealed Religion
cannot bring theseObjeclions3 one that does not
believe it has no ri tto urge them. For if he be
senfible that the 0 jections are of any force, he
must of neceffrty also admit the Solutions,s1nce
both ofthem depend upon the same Authority. (77.)

NOTES.

(77.) This general Argument liet against all those who briryy
Obyoeiionr from the Scripture Account of the creatio, Fa ,
&e vim either they believe the Trotb and Divine Authority
nl those Rookt, or they do note ii they do, then they moll
believe them also when they deciate that all the Workt of God
are holy arui just and goode and consequentIy that the fore·
mentioned Difficulties are no real Argumenta against the Di·
‚vioe Attributer: if they do note then the whole falle rothe
Ground. For to admit one part of an account and reject the
pthgffbff both depend upon the same Authority‚ is evidently
uo na e. - ·

Objeeliont therefore drawn from the scripture account of
these Motters ean buthe mere Argumenta ad hominem at bell r
eod ete olno force either to melre or justify an Unbelr'ever.

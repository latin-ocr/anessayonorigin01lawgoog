1 have insisted the longer on this Point because 1 see some

indifferent Persona aa to the main Dispute haue thought the '

Author millalcen in hie asserting the Goodness of Things to de·
peud immediately on the Will os God. Let me add sarther,
that the Author does not say that the Goodness os Things de·
penda‘soleh on God's Will; but that hit Wisdom and Powec
ar'e likewise concern'd in them: we nrull not separate Gud's·
will from these attributesr un the contrary hia Will islinri-

there can’t be any thing at all : the very moment we conceive a
thing to be, we mull conceive and suppose that God willa it
to be what it is, and that hewillc it nourd opio Nature and

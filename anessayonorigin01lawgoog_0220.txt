ther is there a less difference between finning and
dying. 'Tis very true, that no body would let a
srck Person take Wine which heknew would kill
him: but yet any prudent Physician would allow
his Patient to take some Meat, without which he ·
knew that he certainly must¹ die, tho' he understood
that upon taking it the F ever would enerease a little. ⁴
In like manner God has given Reason toMen, with-
out which they would not be Men, tho’ he fore·-
saw that some Evils would arise from it. Reason
therefore ought to be compared to Life, and natu-

take away Reason lest Men should use it amiss, he
would be like a Man that kills his Son sor sear he
should be sick. , ¹ ,

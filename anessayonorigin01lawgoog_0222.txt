¹ where he says, that to permit Men to fin rather than to over·
sule their Wills, is like a Mother that l'ets her Daughters go ιο
'adalh where lhe is sure they will lose th'eir Honouu, and
‘then pleads in her o'wn justification, “that lhe had no mind
“to rellrain the Libertyof ber Daughters, nor to lhew Dis-
ξ’ trust of them.'' Agaln [l] lfa Son llrould see his Fathet
“ready to throw hrrnself out of the Window‚ elther in a fit
ξ( of F renzy, or because h'e is troubled in Mind, hestwould do
“ well to chain him, if he could not restrain him otherwise.'.'
And to name do more.

ln all which this Author evidently millakes the case, by
bompadng the Destrudion ofFree-Will (lor this is the only
thing, as we have proved, that can prevent the abuse of it) .
¹which Wlll has been lhewn to be the very Life and Sool ol
Man3 to suth mere trilles as conlining his Body or disconrpo-
fing his Habit: whereas, from the foregoing account os the
inestimable worth of Liberty to each individua'l, and the many
Adventages thet asise in common, even from the abuse of it,- ·
lt plainly appears that to abridge, or which is the very same,
to deprive a Man of Liberty for sear he ssrould abuse it, would,
in re ard to him, be just as good asto knock blm on the Head
sor ear he lhould maim or disfigure himself. And with rc·
{peel to tb'e Public, he would be far more unreasoneble who
lbould defire tlre absence of this Liberty, because ol its frequent
abusa, than be who lbould wilh that there were no such thing
as Fire, Wind, or Water, in the World, becauss so many Men,
Houses and Ships are destroyed by them.- As the rest of
Bayle's elaborate Similies are founded on the lame rnisrepreleu·
totino, one bint of this kind is, lthinlt, enough to invalidae

them. E e 2 ·

The two cases are very different, as was strewn suffi-
ciently in Note 14. The World, which voe suppose to have
had beginning, might sor that reason either have not been
at all, or been of a different slrape, &a from what it is.
That which never had beginning was never under a possi-

bihty os not being, or os being any thing else but what it ,

always actually was. Here is no effert, nothing that wants
support, consequently no room sor any Cause or Ground.
(Ps. 78.) “ Here I must desire the Reader to take no· ,

This is the absurdity we justly charge upon the Authors of

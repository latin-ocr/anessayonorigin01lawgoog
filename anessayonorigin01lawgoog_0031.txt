'⁰¹¹‘ Nay these can scarce be called indifferent to Aciion aster the
determination of the Will; but follow instantly (as vve ob·

elieth is l have Power to do it, and continue in the same Will
or Resolution. Howevet‚ this indifference os the operative
Powers is what can 'trever constitute lllorality (ar wat ob·

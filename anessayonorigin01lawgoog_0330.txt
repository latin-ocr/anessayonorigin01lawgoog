(as l think Cudworth has sufficiently demonstrated in the
passage cited below) the reason is because it has Parts3 i. e.
is emended, consequently a thinking Substance cannot be
extended or made up of Pa'rts] and if so, it has nothing to
do with either Place or Mation, any more than with aseape
or Celeur. ltymay acl on and inlluence a Body which ex·
ists in Place‚ but to apply Pleu, where, &c (terms which
peculiarly belong to Beings emended) to itsels‚ is joining
the most dis arate, heterogeneons things in Nature. “l ¹
would not, lbys he, mean that the Soul is extended in the
same manner as Matter is.” ib. But if all the notion we can

cannot reach beyond it; if the very Definition and Idea ⁰.f
it includes partes extra partes (real parts, when it is so, men-
tal when it is only mental) as he might have learnt from
Bayle cited above3 it will be in vain to fly to the old re·
fuge of a simple uncempounded Extensron‚ or what he calls
Continuam which is indeed emended, but yet in a diffe-
'rent manner from all the Extenston we know of;¹ which
has allignable Parts, but not material, separable ones·‚ i. e.

(P. 37.) “ Though we frame our Idea osa Being from ⁴ Ι

“ th'e essential Properties of it, yet that is·n0 reason why.
“ the Being should not require something to its Existence
“ which the essential Property (he lhould have said Proper-
“ ties) does not, only by the Being's requiring it.” By
Being or Substance we mean only the Collesliom Aggregate
or Union of the Essenti'al or constituent Properties; and how
these when taken together can-re uire something which each
of thern did not require when leparately considered, l do
not apprchend. The Properties os Spirit, ie. thinking,

ly neither has a spiritual Being which consiste only of these ,

End, by an A& of Choice, our conscience? m-
monstrates against it, Romembrance stings us, ande
we cannot forgive ourselveS, though we were secure
both from human Punllhment and the Wrath of,
God⁸¹ But when the same Evils befal us by exter·
nal F-orce or the Neceffity of Nature, we bewail
ourCondition indeed, and complain of Fortune,
but have none of that wounding Anxiousness, an'd

Principle. For as it is impoffible but that he should
accuse himself, who believes that heis the true »
cause of his own Misery; so on the other hand, ’tis 1
certain that he who does accuse himself, thinks that
he himself is the true cause of his Misery: othon
wife he would grieve, complain, and be angry with “
the Person that compelled him to¹ commit such
things as he finds make him uneasy, but would ne*
ver condemn himself as the Cause and Author of
them, unless he were conscious that he could have
hindered them. lfthe grief arisrng from a Crime
be distinet from that which is occasroned by a Mil· ,
fortune, ’tis plain that this can be on no other ae· .
count, than because the Crlme proceeds from a free
Agent, i. r. one who determines himself to helion,
but the Misfortune from a necessary one.

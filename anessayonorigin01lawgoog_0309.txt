, Whilst young children are under their Parenss Govern-

ment and Caro, they are solicitous about noth' ς They
are not concern’d about their Meet, Drink or S ety, any
further than to call to their Parents for them when they want
them: nor are they afraid while they are near them: but if

’ they should withdraw themselves, and leave their Children

in the dark, or in aWilderness, their Eyes would soon be
llil autissiod? suits sessurus
· seiae them, and take away the uscos the little Reason they
have. We may imagine this to be the Condition of our first
'Parente when God withdrew his Influence and protectior
from them upon their deserting him. Their Eyes were
opened as soon as they were left to themselves. Tlusv found
their Neceffities and Wants. They found the honhess of·
their own Power to help mem, and insufficiency of their
own Understanding to dire& them. They found themselves
incompetent Judges of what was good or evil for them, and
they then in earnest, to their eost, knew Evil, that is, felt
it. This was a natural consequence of their setting up to

, be their own Masters, and to judge for themselves: no

finite Understanding being sufficient to soresee or know
what in the infinite variety of our Circumstances may hutt

us, and tho’ it did foresee them, yet nothing less than an
Almighty Power is able to prevent the Mischief. The
opening therefore of our first Parents Eyes to see their im-
pendent Miseries, and their Impotency to help themselves,
was the first effesl of their Sin.

The 2d was their sense of their being naked, and shame
that they were so. Shame proceeds from aConsciousness of
Weakness, or of Guilt, and from a secret Pride that makes
us unwilling to own it, lest we should be despised for it.
Man could not be conseious of either before his F all, because
he was innocent from Guilt, and was covered by the Power
of God against all the desesls of his natural Weaknesr,
but being now left to himself, he felt both. He had of-
fended God, and had no desence against his follow-Crea-
tures: the Sun scorch'd him, the Rain wet him, and the
Cold pierc’d him. He found an Intonveniency inexposm
his B0dy, and was aslram’d of the Effesls os it. Hehsousnldf

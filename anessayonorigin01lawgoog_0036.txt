Power has no Bounds,* nor is there any thing · “
wherein it cannot please itself, if it does but happen

to be ,determined to it. ‘Now fince the natural Ap-
petites themselves may be contrary to each other

(as we have lhewnyand one of them be overoome

by the Excess of another, how much more easily

may this power be conceived to go against these
Appetites, and fince ‘it is of a very different and su-
perior kind, 'tis probable th'at it can conquer all
others, and be itlelf subdued by none.

XIII. Nay we may imagine it to be given for It scens
ms very End, that the Agent migh't‘have wherein ²⁰1³}st

very often happens. As the natural Powers, and Agent
Appetites receive Pleasure and Pain from Objecls, prght
they must neceffarily be deprived of Pleasure and ffihing

undergo Pain, aceording to the⁸ Laws of Motion, eodelight ,

and the order of external things, Since then they in when
are often frustrated, they must render the Agents ‘¹¹⁶ ⁰²³⁰·

'them capable of Happinels3 But the Agent cau lllhllllly

vantage to it to be able to quit the other Appetites, straten.

and please itlelf in restraining them, or adting con-

trary to them. For fince every F aculty is satisfied

in its exercise, the Strength of this cannot be moro

signally displayed in any thing, than-in running

counter sometimes to all the Appetites. For this ‚

must either be sometimes done, or the Agent must glyy‘oip.

,be destitute of all manner of Good, and remain en· acceium,

tirely miserahle; since by the Laws of Nature, things encreases

contrary to the Appetites† must be endured. ‘sl‘ pipa-

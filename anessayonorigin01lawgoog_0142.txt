&eternum OfMaraI Evit Ι ὁ3 51,

Objestc are fixed, as we said before ξ and can never

answer to our natural Appetites in every Particular.

ln order therefore to the attainment of continual
Happiness, it was necessary that we should be able

to please ourselves in some respect, independently of

the Undetstanding‚ and by Elediion to constitute

those things good and agreea‘ble to us, which the Un·
derstanding, if there had been no such Elesiion‚

would have pronounced offenfive, disagreeable and
painful: From hence it appears how fit it is that this

Power should be freed from the Government of the
Understanding·; but if it is freed, it could not be

· determined by it. · ’ ⁴
XIV. Fourthly, It is to be observed that the The

’ Divine Power is Infinite‚ and that there are innu- G⁰⁰d¹¹²s⁸
merable things poffible to it which are repugnant to {wls
one another, and destrudtive of each other, and'God be-
cannot by any means be consistent. Is therefore ing equal ’

God should ast according to the Infinity of his ἔξω
Power, without any regard to his other Attributes‚ hffi’
he would effeti nothing at all, or else immediately him from
destroy what he had effedted. His 'infinite Wisdom chqofing ”
and Goodness therefore gave bounds and restraint amsi*
toliis Power‚ which would otherwise confound

every thing ; and these must of necessity be equally ⁴
infinite with his Power‚ otherwise infinite Evila

must certainly arise from infinite Power. But a

creature, aa his Elective Power necessarily entende Ι
sarther than his Wisdom and Goodness‚ is made na-

turally

NOTES.

Part tf tur Happiness‚ because «we do not will it, is asserted by
Mt. Locle [b and well urged as a Reason why the greater Good
does not ab olutely determine the Minde aud the sarne‚·I
think, might aa juilly be alhrmed osl’ain, viz. That the re··
moral of all Pain dues not malteafneeessary part osout present
Happinesa fince we do not always absolutely will ot deſjre to
remove itt hut on the contrary choose to bear it, and by that
cholet, ouen produce a Pleasute, which· does more than coun-
tuballance it. SeeC. ς. 8οᾶ.·2. and Note45. -

solves, and are mo excellently adopted to their several U-
ses and Ends, we are sure there is a Power in God who
orders them, equivalent to Knowledge and Understanding3
and because we know not what it is in icfels, we 'give it
these Names. · · “

tvl. Lassly, The use of Foreknowledge withus is to
prevent any Surprize when Events happen, and that we
may not be at a loss what to do by things coming upon ue
unawares. Now inahnueh as we are certain that nothing
can surprize God, and that he can never beat a loss what
oo do in any Event, therefore we conclude that God ¹has a
Faculty to which our F ore-knowledge bears some analogy,
and therefore we call it by that Narne.
· But it does, not follow from hence that any os these are
more properly and literally in God, after the manner that
they are in us, than Hands or Eyes, than Mercy, Love,
or Hatred are ; but on the contrary we must acknowledge
that those things, which we call by these Names, wiern at·
tributod to God, are of so very different a nature horn
what they are in us, and so superior to all that we can con·
ccicc, thatin reality there is no more l'rkeness between
them, than between our Hand and God’s Power: nor can
we draw Consequences fronr the real Nature of one to that
’ of the other with more justnefs of Reason, than we can
conclude, because our Hand consrstt of F ingero and Joints,
that therefore the Power of God is distinguished by such
Parts. ¹·

And therefore to argue because F ore-knowledge, as it is
in us, if supposed infallible, cannot consrst with the Con·
tingency of· Events‚ that therefore what we call fo in God
cannot, is as far from Reafon‚ as it would be to conclude,
becaueour Eyes cannot see in the dark‚ that therefore,
when God is said to see· all things, his Eyes must be en-
lightened with a perpetual Sunlhine; or because we cannot
love or hate without Paffion, that therefore when the Scn‘p-
tures ascribe these to God, they teach ut that he ξε eliade

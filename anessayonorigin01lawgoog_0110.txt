determined b the lall ast us the Und‘ertlancling‚ this ia lhewn
to be equivalent tu neceffity, because the Underllandingis ne·
celsary aud obliged to judge aa things appear to it. And at tu
the ad, that places an indiffercnce in the Will, the Author has
“ shewn, Chap. ς. Sesl. 1. Subsesl. 2. par. 8. that mere indisse-
rence os Choice is of no use, but rather an impediment to Hap-
piness, except the Will have at the same time apower to make ·
the thing chosen agreeable. If such a Power he in the With,
'the Author lhews‚ Subsesl. 3⁸ osche same Seu. Par. 22. that ι
the Agent effess'd os it may be happy tho‘ he have a ver'y int·
pertesi Un5erllauding and commit many Mistakes. -κ

Puwer, it is not material whether we know or believe that we
have it or no, sor whatever our opinion os it bea it will do ita
own Worlc. Is a Man believe himself free, as generally Men‘
do, when he really is necessitated by a force he do'th nat pen
ceive, he ia never the sreer ou that account. And is he believe
himself neceffitated contrary to what he feels in his own Minu,
aa suune are persuaded to de by the so histieal Argumenta os
vain Philolachete, he ia never the les} srce sor that. And
, hence it is that whatever opinion Men have concerning the
Freedum or neceffity os choice‚ they are equally pleased or ,dis-
pleased with it, when once it is rnade ς because the yleasure
doeh not arise srotn their opinion concerning the Facu ty, but
stum the use os it. ·

Rut lastly‚ 'tis said that guod Angels and Saints in Heaveu
ltave nu such Liberty aa thiat that the good Angeia are yer-
aaty determined to love God, aud the Souis of Menas uon
aa they enter Heave'u, cease to be indifferent to Goud and Evil,
and can't maire an other than a good Choice. .

ls this is intend against the Author’s Posttiou, the inserente Α
null be either that the Angeia aud Saints do not choose to bc
in Heaven, or that Heaven doth not please because 'they choose

, to be there, neither os which Consequences do at all follow.
· ’ But thenis it not strange that a Liberty os indifference which
nmaina no longer than uurmiserable sojourning on Barth, and
ia at attend aa suun aa a Man begins to be perseslsy hapyy,
should be necessary to out Happinese‚ and the Fuuutain o it
luere? Το which 1 answer, that the whole Argument ia souu-
deden a great Mistake. ,

The Author believes that the Angels and hleffed in Heaven

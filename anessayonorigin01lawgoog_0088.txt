Nam maala bomo mentis conpos est, etiamst vehementiffime ab

ln answer to this, which seems the strength of what is ab*
jedled against the Author's Notion ofLiberty, Ι delire these
few things may be confider'd: ' ,

First, that ir is not easy to comprehend this neccffity of Con·
tradidlion, which isinconsrstent with Liberty', or to distinguisst
it from-'that Necellit'y which is only founded on Conuenient , ,
and yet never fails co succeed, because there ia always a suth·
eient Reann or cause to produce the effcdl. 1 wilh there had
been an Example given of theone and t'other that we might
leave been able to passa better ludgmeut of them. For to me
it seems that at thrs rate all the actions of Beasts are aa free aa -
those of Men. If a beast be never so hungry, and turn’d out

into never so tempting a Pastore, yet there is no Contradiclion'

*in saying that he may abstain from eating. Nor do I l'ee 'how ζ

hia Appetites being determin'd an'y‘more oblige ,him to eat,-
than a Man't, when all circumstances, Motives, Predispofitiy
ons and Qualificationa incline him to it„ r ·> · '' ’“ “’

¹adl , At this rate the effens ofall natural Censes would be v ,

free. hor it ia no contradiction to say the Son will notrise
to morrow, buthir rising is no more free on that account. .
And in truthI do notfind that any Proposrtions hut those that
concern metaphysical and aunan Verium, are in this Senle
necessary·- All the efferte of natural Causea have only a pofitr've
or hy' theticnl neceffity, that depende on the Will of God-
Yet isirin consider only the Son, and the part he has in raifing
himself, he cannot be said in' any tolerable sense to ne free in .
rising. And lo if we consider all things given which arene-

teffaty to an helion, either a Mau can in these circumstances “

fdrbear his· Achiuo, or he cannot t 'if he' can he ia indifferent,

{or 'payait omnibus ad agendum rrqmfitis potest agere vel non ageni

whre ia' the ¹very detinidon osan indifferent, free Agent: lf
he can't suspend the ael, theh ‘is the neceffity as great on hine
in these circumstancesns on the Son to rise. ’

If it be said the case ir different, because a Man has Under·
standing which it always ready to suggest to him new Confide-
rationr to stop hia Aetione. lanswer, whence corne these new , ,
Confidetatione that alter the Man's circumstances? lffrom the ,
will, then it determines itself after all, and ia not determin’d
by any dis fidon, motioe or reason from without: But it

⁴ these Conli' eratione that change the will are independent of
it, a'nd ariselrom any external dispofiriom reason or inclinatior,-
he iano more free that is determin'd to his Choicehy thyse,

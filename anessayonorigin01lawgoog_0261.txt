mine what is consrstent or not consistent with them, than
a blind Man ought to determine, from what he hears or
feels, to what Objests the sense of Seeing reaches: for this
were to reason from things that are only comparatively
and improperly ascribed to God, and by way of analogy
and accommodatiori to our Capacities‚ as if they were pro-
perly and univocally the same in him and in us. -

ls we would spealc the Truth, those PowerS, Propertiee
and Operatione, the Names of which we transfer to God,
are but faint Shadows and Resemblances‚ or rather indeed
Emblems and parabolical F igores os the Divine Amibutes',
which they are desrgned to srgnify; whereas his Attributes

finitely superior and different ⁸from any thinlgnwe discem

in his Creatures, or that can be conceived by ite Under-
standings, that we cannot with reason pretend to make any
other Deducnons from the Natures os one to that of the¹
others, than those he has allowed us to make, or extend
the Parallel any farther than that very lnstance, which the
resemblance was desrgned to teach us.

Thus F ore-knowledge and Prcdestination, when attribu·
ted to God, are defigned to teach us the Obligations which
we owe to him for our Salvation and the Dependance we
have on his F avour3 and so far we may use andpress them:
but to conclude srom thence that these are inconsistent with
Free-Will, is to sup se that they arethe same in him and
us ·, and just as reasciirable as to inser, because Wisdorn is

compared in Scripture to a Troe of Life, that therefore it

cern that Parenta lhew towards their Children: and there-
fore we are to conceive of him as having all the tenderness

of Affeetron, thatParents secl in their Heart towards their
young ones; and that if he had been so affected, he could
not (considering our circumstances) have gone farther
than he has done to save us; that our Destrueiion is as in·
tirely due to ourselves, as if, we were out of God¹s Power,
and absolutely in the hand of our own counsel.

§ XXVII. If we take these as Schemes delign'd to give
us different Views of God, and his Transactions· with Men,
in order to obligetis to distinct Duties which we owe him,
and stretch,thern no farther, they are very reconcileable:
And to go about to clalh theone against the other, and at·
lanthilde iltihheghilhthhlizathio
that Christ sits on the right hand of God, because Scripture
in other places, and plain Reason affures ut, that Godhath
neither Hand nor Parta. , “ ”

And whilst a thing may in one respeci be like another,
and in other respecta be like the contrary; and whilst we
know that thing only by resemblance, similitude, or propor-
tion·, we ought not to be surpriz'd, that the Representations
are contrary, and taken from things that seem irreconcilable,
or that the different Views of the same thing lhould give
occasion to different, nay contrary Schemes. .

ξ XXVIII. We ought farther to consider, that these are
not so much defign'd to give us Notions of God as heis
in himself, as to make us sensrble of our Duty to him, and
to oblige us to perform it. As for Example, when the

,- Scriptures represent God as an absolute iord, that has his

Creatures intirely in his Power, and treats them according to
his pleasure; as one that is not oblig’d to consider their Ad-
vantage at all, or any thing but his own Will·, that may
elect one to eternal Salvation, and pass over another, or
condemn him to eternal Misery, without any other reason
but because he will do so: When we read this, ·I say, in the
· ¹ holy ScriptureS, we ought not to dispute whether God really
aeis thus orno, or how it will suit with his other Attributes

of Wiyilam and Justice to do so; but dre use we ought 312

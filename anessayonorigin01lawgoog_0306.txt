norant of the nature of Beasts, and for ought llre knew,
all of them mightspeak as well as Adam did. This Igno-
rance could be no hurt to her, for if lhe had destr’d to
know, lhe had no more to do but to apply herself to God,
who was her immediate Diffidet, and would have discover’d
it to her, if she had alk'd it ·, and we are not to doubt but
it was as easy for her to have had recourse to him, as itis
ἵ sor us to open our Eyes in order to see; and therefore lhe
was as inexcusable as a Man would be that shordd fall into a
Pit because he would not look before him.

But 4thly. Tho' this was a true literal Serpent, yet there
was moreio it, the Devil made use of it to compass his
’ Ends: And he was the Person that spake through it. This, -
as I take it, is confess’d by all; for no Brute could ever rea·
son'or speak os itstlf ε And it ought to be observ’d that
when the worship of the Devil w'as settled in the world, a

Serpent was the Sign and Symbol of whatever was sacred ,

to him, he was worshipped rmder that form, and seem’d to
take a peculiar Pleasure to appear and receive homage in
that Shape in which he deceived Man. Add to this, that
a Serpent was the Beast by which he vented his Orodes in
many Places, and the very Wotd by which his Divinations
are signified in several Languages is taken from this Ani-

Se nt. ·

dio, sor God doth knoao, thatin the Day ye oot thereos, then
your Eyes shall bo openod, ond yo shall be os 'Gods knoaoing Good

ond Evil. The Meaning of this seems to be as if he had. '

said, God doth but mock you, when he threatens you with
Death; this is not the reason why he forbids you the Ule of
this Tree: the true desrgn is to keep you in Ignorance, to
blindfold you, and hinder you from judging for yourselves
by your own Eyes and Reason. By this means you are
· kept altogether in a dependance on him, and obliged iu all
cases to have recourse to isim, and not suffer’d to enquire

by the strength of your own F aculties, what may burt or
help you„ ou have not the use of the Senses andstlalppiprg· ·

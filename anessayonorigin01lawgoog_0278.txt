by h'er continual Cries and Petitions so troubled' him, that

· Thus it is said Erod. 33.11. Theerdspake anto Moses x

facetosum, asa Man speakcth tr his Friead. And yet in
ver. so. he declares to the sameMoses, Thou canst notsee
my Face: [ον there shall ·no Man see me, and live. There
are multitudes of other lnstances of the like nature, that
seem to carry some appearance os a contradiction inthem,
but are purposely destgn’d to make us understand that these ,
are only ascrib’d to God by way of resemblance and analo- »
gy, and to corres't our Imaginations, that we may not mis-
takethem for perfest Representations, or think that they are
in God in the same manner that the Similitudes represent '
them, and to teach us not to lbetch those to all Cases, or
¹farthefr than they are intended. · · · ’
§xxtv We ought to rememben that two things may
be very like one another in some respests, and quite contrary
. in others; and yet to argue against the Likeness in one re·
spesi, from the Contrariety in the other, is as isone should
dispute against the Likeness of a Pisture, because thatis ’
made of Canvas, Oil, and Colours, whereas the Original is
Flesh andBlood. ·
· Thus in the present Case, God is represented as an abso-
lute Lord over his 'Creatorem of infinite Knowledge· and
'Power‚ that doth all things sor his mere Pleasure, and isac·
countable to none; as one that will have Merty on whom
, he will have Mum, and whom he will he hardem3 that fors-
fies, predestinatcs, calls, justifies, and gloriſses‘whom he will,
without any regard to the Creatures whom he thus deals
with. This gives us a mighty Notion os his Sovereignty,
at once stops our Motum, and silentes our Objedb'ons3
obliges us to an absolute Submiffion, and ‘dependance on
him, and withal to acknowledge the good thing's ,we enjoy
to be intirely due to his pleasure. This is plainly the De·
sign and Effert of this terrible Representation: and the
meaning is, that we should understand that God is no way .

oblig’d to give us an account of his hstium that we are⁸
. no
